# ASSIGNMENT 2 - A GAME OF PIPES

Run these two commands in the _assignment2_ file:

`gcc player1.c stringGame.c -o player1 -std=c99`

`gcc player2.c stringGame.c -o player2 -std=c99`

Run _player1_ first and then _player2_ on a separate terminal.

TODO LIST:
- Strategy and techniques
- Makefile

Known bugs:
- Entering more than 16 characters as _player1_ causes strange behavior
- Entering more than 1 character during editting as either player also causes strange behavior
