# ASSIGNMENT 2
## A GAME OF PIPES

To compile the game properly you need to run these two commands:

`gcc player1.c stringGame.c -o player1 -std=c99`

`gcc player2.c stringGame.c -o player2 -std=c99`

When you're ready to start playing begin by running `player1` first and then `player2`

TODO LIST:
- Strategy and techniques
- Makefile

Known bugs:
- Entering more than 16 characters as `player1` causes strange behavior
- Entering more than 1 character during editting as either player also causes strange behavior
